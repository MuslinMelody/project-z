		<h1>Luna's banishment</h1>
	</header>
	<main>
		<p>General story context: A bunch of wizards raised and lowered the sun and moon every day, and that was pretty tiring. However, a couple of sisters were born with the ability to do it easily: Celestia and Luna. Celestia was in charge of the sun, and Luna the moon. Luna didn't like that everyone liked the sun more than the moon, did bad things (as Soldiers, Children, and The Moon Rises hypothesize about), and Celestia was forced to trap Luna in the moon (Lullaby for a Princess).</p>
		<h2>The Moon Rises</h2>
		<p><a href="karaoke.html/?song=moonrises">Karaoke</a></p>
		<p>I found a thing on MuseScore that helped me do a lot of it, but it doesn't cover the entirety of the song. I'm filling in the gaps, but I'm more mistake-prone than a professional, so it's not entirely accurate.</p>
		<p>This song was written by ponyphonic, who released both the original and a re-mastered version. DuoCartoonist did their cover with animation and vocals of their own. The singer of ponyphonic's re-mastered version uploaded her vocals with DuoCartoonist's animation.</p>
		<p>The melody and rhythm in DuoCartoonist's version were slightly different than ponyphonic's. Overall, I don't believe it matched ponyphonic. However, it did provide some key insights in how to perform this song well. Therefore, the karaoke presented is a mixture of the two.</p>
		<h2>Children of the Night</h2>
		<p><a href="karaoke.html/?song=children">Karaoke</a></p>
		<p>I found the notes on <a href="https://musescore.com/user/179063/scores/171054" target="_blank">Musescore</a>, I didn't transcribe this one myself.</p>
		<p>Children of the Night was made by DuoCartoonist. The video, and the entire DuoCartoonist channel, were removed by COPPA. This is a sad thing. They weren't my favorite channel, but I really appreciated it. MLP has been getting hit by COPPA quite a bit, but reuploads are a thing, so you can find a copy of Children of the Night with a couple searches.</p>
		<p>I chose this project in part because of this song. Preservation of good content is important when it's in danger.</p>
		<h2>Soldiers of the Night</h2>
		<p><a href="karaoke.html/?song=soldiers">Karaoke</a></p>
		<p>I've been transcribing this myself from the video, so I don't have everything correct.</p>
		<p>This song was written by SlyphStorm, and a cover was later made by 4everfreebrony. This song was based on the original, omitting a stanza at the beginning.</p>
		<h2>Lullaby for a Princess</h2>
		<p><a href="karaoke.html/?song=lullaby">Karaoke</a></p>
		<p>I've been transcribing this myself from the video, so I don't have everything correct.</p>
		<p>This song was written by ponyphonic. WarpOut built an <a href="https://youtu.be/i7PQ9IO/" target="_blank">uncontestedly beautiful animation</a> around it over the course of two years, omitting the first "Lullay, Moon... forgive me for being so blind" part present in the original.</p>
