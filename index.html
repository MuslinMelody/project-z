		<p>I can assure you that 80% of my target audience was between 15 and 25 in 2013.</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p>Fate has been cruel and order unkind, how can I have locked you away?</p>
		<p>The blame was my own, the punishment mine, the locksmith's on vacation today</p>
		<p>But into the stillness, I'll bring you a song, and I will your company keep</p>
		<p>Until my phone call to my chain-and-ball has carried you out of my jeep</p>
		<br>
		<p>Once did a driver who shone like the sun look out on her dashboard and sigh</p>
		<p>She smiled and said "surely there is no driver so cautious and so muchly careful as I"</p>
		<p>So great was her soul and so brilliant her ego that long was the shadow she cast</p>
		<p>Which fell dark upon the keys that she loved, and grew only darker as days and nights passed</p>
		<br>
		<!-- The animation that this parody is based on skips this, but the original music had it. -->
		<p>Lullay car keys, goodnight precious mine, rest now in ignition's embrace</p>
		<p>Bear up my lullaby, exhaust of the truck, through windshield and door and trunk space</p>
		<p>Carry the peace and the coolness of night, and carry my sorrow in kind</p>
		<p>Car keys, you're loved so much more than you know, forgive me for my slip of mind</p>
		<br>
		<p>Soon did that driver take notice that she did not give her life its due</p>
		<p>And neither had she cared as much as deserved, she watched as her own absent-mindedness grew</p>
		<p>But such is the way of forgetfulness, sweetly takes hold of the mind of its host</p>
		<p>And that foolish driver did nothing to stop the ensnarement of one who had needed her most</p>
		<br>
		<p>Lullay car keys, goodnight precious mine, rest now in ignition's embrace</p>
		<p>Bear up my lullaby, exhaust of the truck, through windshield and door and trunk space</p>
		<p>Carry the peace and the coolness of night, and carry my sorrow in kind</p>
		<p>Car keys, you're loved so much more than you know. May troubles be far from your mind, and forgive me for my slip of mind</p>
		<br>
		<p>The hours now before us, kinda cold, alone</p>
		<p>I never imagined I'd face them on my phone</p>
		<p>May these thousand minutes swiftly pass, I pray</p>
		<p>I love you, I miss you, all these meters away</p>
		<br>
		<p>May all your dreams be sweet tonight</p>
		<p>Safe upon your bed of phone light</p>
		<p>And know not of sadness, pain, or care</p>
		<p>And when I open the door I will meet you there</p>

		<p>What is now the new player (karaoke2.html) does not have support for the <code>pusht</code> and <code>popt</code> commands, but does have support for <code>push t</code> and <code>pop t</code> and a couple other push and pop things that you won't actually use and none of the other push and pop things that you would use. New instructions are <code>notext</code> and <code>text</code>, which disable the karaoke words. <code>vol 0</code> now skips writing to the audio buffer, but still skips the time. It is effectively equivalent to the <code>no</code> pitch argument in this way, although with <code>no</code>, it is not possible to put karaoke words on the screen. Using both <code>notext</code> and <code>vol 0</code> is equivalent to the <code>no</code> pitch argument.</p>
