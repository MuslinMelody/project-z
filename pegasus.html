		<h1>The Pegasus Device</h1>
	</header>
	<main>
		<p>An MLP fanfiction called Pegasus Device inspired three songs: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRx_iXgLAyw" target="_blank">Rainbow Factory by WoodenToaster</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytKvgLuy7ng" target="_blank">Awoken by WoodenToaster and H8_Seed</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wzb76EFqZkg" target="_blank">Pegasus Device by SlyphStorm</a>. The fanfiction itself wasn't extremely bad (I wouldn't recommend it), but the end wasn't very satisfying. In essence, rainbows are made by Cloudsdale Weather Corporation in its rainbow factory. A component of this factory, called the pegasus device, extracts the color from and kills the children provided to it. These children are those who couldn't pass their flight test.</p>
		<p>Due to an unfortunate incident in which the original lyrics of the song Pegasus Device include the words 'purple' and 'orange' on the same line that would make any non-brony automatically die, I replaced the line.</p>
		<p>Someone who sounds like Rainbow Dash has covery things of all three:  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dquw2i_GX4w" target="_blank">Rainbow Factory</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e87k8UqVRns" target="_blank">Awoken</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ZrMvFmSKDo" target="_blank">Pegasus Device</a>.
